CYCLES PER SECOND (HERTZ) AND CORRESPONDENCES
The gathering and portrayal of this information was performed by Lisa Gongster, a Co-Founder, and Manager.
She deserves full credit for this work’s display.
These frequencies are of all types; light, sound, electrical, etc. The two- or three-character source codes after each frequency are defined in the bibliography.



0.1-1 Organ/muscle resonances [SS]
0.1-3 Delta range, according to [NEU+CRI] – deep sleep, lucid dreaming, increased immune functions, hypnosis [NEU]; Decreased awareness of the physical world. Access to unconscious information. Dominant brainwave in infants under one year old. This range normally decreases when we focus, but this doesn’t happen when a person with ADD – delta waves actually increase when they try and focus. [CRI]; “Monroe focus 21” [MB2 via DW];
0.16 – 10 – Neuralgias [AT]
0.18 – 10 – Mod. therapy [AT]
0.20 – 0.26 – Dental pain [AT]
0.20 – 10 – Post-traumatics [AT]
0.28 – 2.15 – Alcohol addiction [AT]
0.28 – 10 – Arthritis [AT]
0.30 – 0.15 – Depression [AT]
0.30 – 10 – Cervobrachial syndrome [AT]
0.37 – 2.15 – Drug addiction [AT]
0.40 – 10 – Confusion [AT]
0.45 – 10 – Muscle pain [AT]
Below 0.5 – Epsilon range, extraordinary states of consciousness, high states of meditation, ecstatic states of consciousness, high-level inspiration states, spiritual insight, out-of-body experiences, Yogic states of suspended animation. [CNR]
0.5 – very relaxing, against headache [MB], for lower back pain [AS] ; Thyroid, reproductive, excretory stimulant, whole brain toner [SS]
0.5-1.5 Pain relief [SS + CMP] ; endorphins, better hypnosis [SS]
0.5-3 Delta range, according to [RA]
0.5-4 Delta range, according to [SS,PWM+AWI]. Deep dreamless sleep, trance, suspended animation [SS]; Anti-aging. Reduces amount of cortisol, a hormone associated with stress & aging. Increases the levels of DHEA (anti-aging) & melantonin (decreases aging process.) [BAR]; Associated with unconscious mind & sleep state – in conjunction with other frequencies in a waking state, “Delta acts as a form of radar – seeking out information – reaching out to understand on the deepest unconscious level things that we can’t understand through thought process.” Provides intuition, empathetic attunement & instinctual insight. [AWI]; Conducive to miracle type healing, divine knowledge, inner being & personal growth, rebirth, trauma recovery, “one with the universe” experiences (samadhi), near death experience, characterized by “unknowing”, merely a blissful “being” state such as deep sleep or coma. [PWM via DW]
The anti-aging info comes from a Brainwave Generator preset authored by TheMind2 – he uses binaurals at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 & 4.0 HZ. They all play simultaneously.
0.9 Euphoria [SS]
0.95 – 10 – Whiplash [AT]
1-3 – Delta: deep, dreamless sleep, trance state, non-REM sleep [??]; profound relaxation, restorative sleep, feelings of tranquility&peace, if one can remain aware [VUG via DW]
There’s disagreement over where the delta range begins & ends – [SS,PWM+AWI] list it as 0.5 to 4.0 HZ, [NEU] 0.1 to 3.0 HZ, & [RA] considers it 0.5 to 3.0 HZ.
1.0 – Feeling of well-being, pituitary stimulation to release growth hormone; overall view of inter-relationships; harmony & balance [MB]
1.05 Helps hair grow + get its color back [RA]; pituitary stimulation to release growth hormone (helps develop muscle, recover from injuries, rejuvenation effects) [HSW]
1.2 – (used on) headaches [RS]
1.45 – Tri-thalamic entrainment format. According to Ronald deStrulle, creates entrainment between hypothalamus, pituitary & pineal. May benefit dyslexics + people with Alzheimer’s. [MP2]
1.5 Abrahams Universal Healing Rate [SS]; Sleep [NEU]; Those individuals whose ailments have manifested into the fourth stage of Chronic Fatigue, where some form of disease is apparent, experienced a release from the negative sensation of their symptoms when moved into 1.5HZ. [NYT via NEU]
1.8 Sinus Congestion seems to clear centering around 1.8 HZ [MPT] (tested with binaural beats, primarily)
2.15 – 10 – Tendovaginatis [AT]
2.06 Associated with coccyx (small triangular bone at end of the spinal column) [TOS]
2.30 Associated with genitals [TOS]
2.5 – pain relief, relaxation [MB]; production of endogenous opiates. [EQ]; Use for sedative effect [ESP]; Sedative effect – reported use on bleeding, bruises, insomnia, and sinusitis. [RS] Sexual stimulation? [SX]
2.57 Associated with bladder [TOS]

3.0-5.5 – “Theta1” Range. [DW]
[DW] divides the Theta Range into Theta1 & Theta2.
3.0 Increased Reaction Time [RT] [SS]; 3.0 HZ & below used to reduce muscle tension headaches, but worked less well on migraines & sinus headaches. [RED]; used to treat allergies, in conjunction with 330 HZ [RS]
3.07 Associated with hara (3cm or 1.5 inch below navel, balance of pelvis) [TOS]
3 – 4 Influences physical vision [SS]
3 – 6 Childhood awareness/vivid memories [SS+RA]
3 – 8 Theta Range according to [NEU]; deep relaxation, meditation, increased memory, focus, creativity, lucid dreaming, hypnagogic state [NEU]
3.4 – Sound sleep
3.5 – Feeling of unity with everything, accelerated language retention [×]; enhancement of receptivity [MB]; Earth Resonance (?) [SS]; (a remedy for) depression & anxiety [ESR]; Wholebeing regeneration, DNA stimulation [DIV]
[MPT] I was under the impression the Earth Resonance is 7.83 HZ – unless [SS] is talking about a different earth resonance.
3.5-7.5 – Theta Range [per CRI] – Creativity, intuition, daydreaming, fantasizing, recollection, imagery, dreamlike, switching thoughts, drowsiness; “oneness”, “knowing”, repository for memories, emotions, sensations. Can lead to trance-like states. Theta strong during internal focus, meditation, prayer + spiritual awareness. Reflects state between wakefulness+ sleep. Relates to subconscious. Observed in anxiety, behavioral activation+behavioral inhibition. Promotes learning+memory when functioning normally. (I think they mean it helps you process what you’ve learned – if you tried to actively learn while in the theta state, I doubt you’d have success – but sometimes the theta state can give your subconscious a chance to chew the proverbial fat that you’ve learned during the day, and digest it.) Abnormal in awake adults, but seen in children up to 13 years old. Suppression of theta can help concentration/focus of attention. [CRI]
3.6 (a remedy for) anger & irritability [ESR]
3.84 Associated with ovaries (Effects=vitality, life at every level) [TOS]
3.9 (a remedy for) unsociable behavior [ESR]; Theta/Delta brainwave range – crystal clear meditation, lucid dreams, enhanced inner awareness, “facilitates easy access to inner resources & creates space for inner peace + self-renewal”. [SED]

4-7 – Theta Range : recall, fantasy, imagery, creativity, planning, dreaming, switching thoughts, Zen meditation, drowsiness; Access to subconscious images, deep meditation, reduced blood pressure, said to cure addictions [SS]; Reset the brain’s sodium potassium levels, which cuts down on mental fatigue [INT]; Increases sex drive [INT] ; Meditation, Intuitive Augmentation [NEU]; Near Sleep brainwaves, conducive to profound inner peace, “mystical truths”, transforming unconsciously held limiting beliefs, physical & emotional healing, purpose of life exploration, inner wisdom, faith, meditation, some psychic abilities, & retrieving unconscious material. [PWB]; bursts of inspiration, twilight sleep learning, deep relaxation, reverie, high levels of awareness, vivid mental imagery. Hypnopompic & Hypnagogic states [NSS via DW]; Military remote viewers operate in this range [RVX]
Some disagreement over the theta range – [NEU] lists it as 3.0 to 8.0 HZ. [AWI] lists it as 4.0 to 8.0 HZ. [RA] & [PWB] both have it as 4.0 to 7.0. [DW] divides it into two ranges, Theta1 (3.0-5.5 hz) & Theta2 (5.5-8.0 hz).
4.0 – 8.0 HZ Theta State according to [AWI]+[VUG via DW] – present in dreaming sleep, deep meditation, storehouse of creative inspiration, spiritual connection, subconscious mind [AWI]; creative insight, twilight (“sleep”) learning, vivid mental imagery. Found in advanced meditators [VUG via DW]
4-12 Skeletal muscle resonances [SS]
4.0 – Enkephalins, Extrasensory perception [MB]; Astral Projection, Telepathy, “Seduction mindset” [DIV]; Catecholamines, vital for memory & learning, respond at around 4 HZ. [PSI]; Subconscious Problem Solving/Full Memory Scanning (if one can manage to stay awake) [RA+CAV via DW]; Associated with object naming, an important aspect of memory [TDM via DW]; “Those who suffer from Chronic Fatigue exhaust very easily. When moved to 4HZ these individuals showed marked improvement in the length of time between the occurrence of exhaustion after certain exercises were completed.” [NYT via NEU]
4.11 Associated with kidneys (Effects=strength) [TOS]
4.5 Shamanic State Of Consciousness/Tibetan Buddhist Chants [MMF via DW]

4.9 – Introspection [SS]; Induce relaxation, meditation, & deeper sleep [ESR]
5.0 – unusual problem solving [×] reduced sleep needed, theta sounds replacing need for extensive dreaming [INT] ; relaxed states, pain-relief (beta endorphin increases of 10-50% reported) [INT]; Alleged Sphincter Resonance (mechanical)(not good) [TB]
5.0 – 10.0 Relaxation [NEU]
5.14 Associated with stomach (Effects=Emotional Acceptance) [TOS]
5.35 Associated with lungs (Effects=Oxygen, Heat) [TOS]
5.5-8.0 “Theta2” frequency range : .. Consists of trains (long runs) of rhythmic frontal activity centering at 6.5-Hz with amplitudes reaching the 50-100 uV (micro-volt) range. .. Is induced in some people by the performance of a mental task such as mental arithmetic, tracing a maze, counting the number of cubes piled in a three-dimensional representation, & imaging a scene. .. More common in extroverts with low traits of neurosis & anxiety. Because Theta2 is associated with mental tasks & its influence is seen in evoked potential latencies, Mizuki (1987) believes that the appearance of Theta2 closely relates to mechanisms of attention or arousal. [DW]
5.5 – Moves beyond knowledge to knowing, shows vision of growth needed ; “Inner Guidance” [SS]; Inner Guidance, intuition, heat generation [DIV]
5.8 (reduce) Fear, Absent-mindedness, Dizziness [ESR]
6.0 – long term memory stimulation [MB] ; (reduce) unwillingness to work [ESR]

6-9.6 Somatic Responses, tingling, pressure, heat [SS]
6.15 Associated with heart (Effects=love, warmth) [TOS]
6.2-6.7 Frontal Midline Theta (Fm Theta) is a specific EEG frequency seen in those subjects actively engaged in cognitive activity, such as solving math problems & playing Tetris [TDM via DW]
6.26-6.6 Hemispheric desync, confusion, anxiety, low Reaction Time, depression insomnia [SS]
6.30 Hz – Mental & astral projection [SS seconded this]; accelerated learning & increased memory retention.[??]; (reduce) Anger + Irritability [ESR]
6.5 – “Center” of Theta2 Brainwave Frequency Range [DW]; “Your frontal lobe, or brain entrainment of the two hemispheres is around 6.5 hz.” [RA]
I quoted the second entry from [RA] directly, due to its ambiguity. It probably ties into what the 5.5-8.0 HZ entry says above.
6.8 Possible use for muscle spasms [ESR] ; associated with telepathy / Schumann Resonance [DHA]
[DHA] associated 6.8 HZ with the Schumann Resonance and the Alpha-Theta borderline. I think this is slightly off – most sources consider the lowest frequency of the Schumann Resonance to be 7.83 HZ, and that’s also considered the borderline between Theta brainwave and Alpha brainwaves.
6.88 Associated with collarbones (Effects=vitality, overall balance, stability) [TOS]
7.0 – 8.0 For healing purposes, like laying of hands by a healer, or self vizualization in a healing situation [RA]; Treatment of Addictions [DW]
7.0 – Mental & astral projection, bending objects, psychic surgery; Increased Reaction Time [SS]; Mass aggregate frequency (can deaggregate matter), alleged to resonate & rupture organs at excessive intensity [TB]; Treatment of sleep disturbances [PGS via DW]
7.5 – Inter-awareness of self & purpose; guided meditation; creative thought for art, invention music, etc.; contact with spirit guides for direction; entry into meditation [MB]; At 7.5 HZ subjects who before suffered from confused thinking reported an ease at finding solutions to troublesome problems after a re-evaluation was conducted. [NYT via NEU]; (?) Earth magnetic field frequency, useful theta (brain) waves frequency [TB]
7.5 – 8 For Treating Alcohol + Drug Addiction – This range of frequencies tells a person they’re satisfied, which is “missing” in addictive personalities [RA]
7.69 Associated with shoulders (Effects=strength of the arms, expansion, teaching) [TOS]
7.8 Schumann Resonance (see 7.83 HZ), ESP activation [DIV]; Doyere’s group (1993), found that short high frequency bursts at 7.7 Hz induced LTP in prefrontal cortex, though only for one day. [AA via DW]
7.8-8 Stimulates ESP, paranormal [SS]
7.83 – Earth Resonance, grounding [×], “Schumann Resonance.” [TS, ESR+HSW, MAG]; anti-jetlag, anti-mind control, improved stress tolerance [SS]; psychic healing experiments [ESR]; pituitary stimulation to release growth hormone (helps develop muscle, recover from injuries, rejuvenation effects) [HSW]; Earth Resonance Frequency – ‘leaves you feeling revitalized like you’ve spent a day in the country.’ [PWM via DW]; reports of accelerated healing/enhanced learning – “the earth’s natural brainwave” [MAG]
[HSW] notes that higher octaves of the 7.83 Schumann Resonance can also stimulate the pituitary in the same way that 7.83 HZ can – especially 31.32 HZ. (One needs to be careful to distinguish between octaves of the 7.83 Schumann Resonance, and the other six Schumann Resonances, which are not higher octaves of 7.83 HZ.)
8-8.6 Reduced Stress/Anxiety [SS]
8.0-10.0 learning new information [MH]; Alpha – Rapid Refreshment 15 min [NEU]; “LOW ALPHA” inner-awareness of self, mind/body integration, balance [CRI]
8.0-12.0 – Alpha range (per NEU, RA, PWM, NSS & CRI) – light relaxation, “super learning”, positive thinking. [NEU]; Conducive to creative problem solving, accelerated learning, mood elevation, stress reduction, etc., characterized by intuitive insights, creative “juice”, inspiration, motivation, daydreams etc. Relaxed, yet alert [PWM via DW]; Associated with calm, relaxed, unfocused (not concentrating), lucid mental states, dream sleep & pleasant drifting feelings or emotions. [NSS via DW] ; promotes mental resourcefulness, aids in mental coordination, enhances relaxation, “Can move quickly + efficiently to accomplish whatever task is at hand.”, feelings of “at ease” + calm, promotes good moods, a bridge between conscious + subconscious, alpha waves indicate a person is alert but not actively processing information, seen more in extroverts than introverts, seen during creative problem solving [CRI]
As you can see, different sources contradict each other. Some paint Alpha as a range of relaxed attentiveness, ideal for learning. Others associate it with “daydreaming” [which doesn’t sound like it would be good for learning]. Unless they’re not talking the “attentive” sort of learning [i.e. sitting in a classroom taking notes], but rather the “trying to assemble it all together in our heads” sort of learning, where our subconscious is doing most of the work in the background, and our conscious mind takes a backseat. I see the Alpha range as the fine line between daydreaming and alertness. It’s like a baseball player on a base – he’ll move away from the base, so that he can steal if the opportunity presents itself. But he always stays close enough to the base so he can get back in case the pitcher throws the ball to the baseman. Alpha Range is the same way – it’s close enough to the “attentive” mental state for us to go to it as needed. But we can also quickly retreat into the realm of sleep if need be. [MPT]
8-13 – Alpha range – Non-drowsy but relaxed, tranquil state of consciousness, primarily with pleasant inward awareness; body/mind integration. ; Amplifies dowsing, empty-mind states, detachment, daydreams, mind/body integration. (can cause) epilectic seizures [SS];
Note : [NEU], [RA], [PWM], [NSS] + [CRI] consider the alpha range to be 8.0-12.0. [AWI] considers it 9.0-14.0. [VUG] has it as 9.0-13.0.
8-14 – Qi Gong and infratonic Qi Gong machine [QG]
8.0 – Past life regression [×]; More Lymphocytes, DNA repair (RAD-6) [SS]; Associated with Base/Muladhara chakra (Color=Red) (Body Parts=Adrenals, Spinal Column, Kidneys) (Effects=Physical energy, will to live)(Note=C) [OML]
8.22 Associated with mouth (Effects=speech, creativity) [TOS]
8.3 – Pick up visual images of mental objects [??]; clairvoyance [SS]; “Monroe Focus 12?” [NEU]
8.6-9.8 Induces sleep, tingling sensations [SS]
9.0, 11.0, 16.0 [bad] documented calcium ion migration (brain tissue) [SS]
There’s some disagreement over whether these frequencies offer anything to fear when used for binaural beats. Here’s the thread from the Brainwave Generator message board : http://groups.yahoo.com/group/bwgen…
9.0 – 13.0 – Alpha Range (according to [VUG]) – relaxed, not thinking about anything in particular, sometimes a pleasurable feeling of “floating”. Often dominant in certain kinds of meditation, alpha waves have for the past twenty years been associated with calm, lucid mental states (the “alpha state”). They’re also often detected during dream sleep. This pattern typically occurs in daydreaming, relaxed awareness, guided or focused imagery & smoothly rhythmic athletic activity. There’s often a euphoric, effortless feeling of “flow” as the doer is absorbed in activity and subject + object are felt to be united. [VUG via DW]
9.0 – 14.0 Alpha Range (according to [AWI]) – Relaxed & detached awareness, visualization, sensory imagery, light reverie. Also, gateway to meditation – provides bridge between the conscious & subconscious mind. [AWI]
9.0 – Awareness of causes of body imbalance & means for balance[×] Blind person phantom touch reading (somatosensory cortex) [RA]; Associated with Sacral/Svadhisthana chakra (Color=Orange) (Body Parts=Gonads, Reproductive System) (Effects=Relationships/Sexuality) (Note=D) [OML]
9.19 Associated with upper lip (Effects=emotions, conflict resolution) [TOS]
9.4 Major frequency used for prostate problems. [ESR] – Self-explanatory. =)
9.41 – Pyramid frequency (outside) (I can’t find a good definition of “Pyramid Frequency”. Anybody?)
9.5-10 – Center of Alpha Range – The brain’s scanning/idling frequency – indicating a brain standing by, waiting to “give way to beta should attention be required, or be the bridge, the gate, to Theta & Delta for drowsiness, sleep, and certain cognitive challenges. [DW]
He gives credit for the ‘brain scanning’ factoid to Eccles & Walter (1950). (It was their conclusion.)
9.6 – Mean dominant frequency associated with earth’s magnetic field [EQ]; Facial Toning [ESR] (I’m not completely sure what “facial toning” is.. Anybody?)
9.8-10.6 Alertness [SS]
10 – enhanced release of serotonin & mood elevator, universally beneficial, use to try effects of other mixes [MB]. Acts as ananalgesic, safest frequency, especially for hangover & jet lag. [EQ] Meg Patterson used for nicotine withdrawal. [MB3] dominant alpha frequency, clarity, normalcy, anti-convulsant, circadian rhythm resync, activate kidneys, raise body temp, more serotonin [SS]; Good when trying to correlate information by the subconscious – Sort of a waiting frequency while the subconscious does the work at lower frequencies. [RA]; Motor impulse coordination (Motor Control cortex) [RA]; Learning a foreign language [RA+PWM via DW]; Centering, Sleep Spindles, Arousal [DIV]; Associated with Solar Plexus/Manipura chakra (Color=Yellow) (Body Parts=Pancreas, Stomach, Liver, Gall Bladder, Nervous System) (Effects=Spiritual wisdom, self-healing)(Note=E) [OML]; Increased alertness (caused by an increase in norepinephrine + serotonin & a decrease in melatonin), sense of well being & decreased pain (caused by increase in beta-endorphins) [RED]; Adrenal Stimulant [RS]; Significant improvements in memory, reading & spelling are reported (in conjunction with 18 HZ) [RUS via DW]; Treatment for Attention Deficit Disorder/Hyperactivity [LUB via DW]; Treatment for closed head injury [HOF via DW]; ‘Berger Rhythm’ [BER via DW]; (used on) headaches [RS]
10-12: HIGH ALPHA RANGE – centering, healing, mind/body connection [CRI]
10-14 Dream/sleep spindles [SS]
10.2 Catecholamines
10.3 Associated With Nasal Passages (Effects=breathing, taste) [TOS]
10.5 – Frequency for healing of body, mind/body unity, firewalking [×]; potent stabilizer & stimulating for the immunity, valuable in convalescence. [MB] Relaxed alertness, contemplation, body healing, mind over matter [SS] Lowering Blood Pressure [RA+PWM via DW]; Associated with Heart/Anahata chakra (Color=Green) (Body Parts=Thymus, Heart, Blood, Circulatory System) (Effects=Love of Life, love of self&others) (Note=F) [OML]
10.6 – Relaxed & alert
10.7 Associated with ears (Effects=hearing, formal concepts) [TOS]
11.0 (& Below) – Stress Reduction (DW)
11-14 Focused alertness [SS]
11.0 (used to) achieve “relaxed yet alert” states. [PWM]
11.5-14.5 An implication for neurotherapy is that if increased intelligence + mental efficiency is the objective, then a frequency band with a 13-Hz center should be used. A more desirable frequency band than 12 to 15-Hz is 11.5 to 14.5-Hz. [DW]
12.0 – Centering, doorway to all other frequencies [×] ; frequency of earth resonance (Hercules – a researcher); Centering, mental stability, transitional point, time seems faster [SS]; To stimulate mental clarity [ESR]; Associated with Throat/Vishuddha chakra (Color=Blue) (Body Parts=Thyroid, Lungs, Vocal Cords) (Effects=Expression/self in society) (Note=G) [OML]
12.0-36.0 Beta Range [per CRI] – dominant brainwave in alert/awake/anxious adults with their eyes open. Comes into play when “listening & thinking during analytical problem solving, judgment, decision making, processing information about the world around us.” [CRI]
12.0-14.0 Learning Frequency – Good for absorbing information passively, when you plan to think about it later. [RA]
[RA] distinguishes between active studying where you’re processing information & passive studying where you’re just trying to absorb information + plan to think about it later. For the former, he suggests 36 to 44 HZ.
12.0-15.0 Beta (low) – relaxed focus, improved attentive abilities [NEU+CRI]; Treating Hyperactivity [RA] ; Sensorimotor Rhythm (SMR) – Used in the treatment of mild autism [AUT via DW]
12.3 Associated with eyes (Effects=Visualization) [TOS]
13-27 – Beta Range (according to [NSS]) – Associated with focused attention towards external stimuli, alert mental activity, normal waking consciousness, & active thought processes. [NSS via DW]
13-30 – Beta Range – Normal wakefulness, the taking in & evaluating of various forms of data received through the senses. It’s present with worry, anger, fear, hunger & surprise. [×] Waking state, motivation, outer awareness, survival, problem solving, arousal, dendrite growth, combats drowsiness [SS]; Conscious Thinking, Autonomic Processes & Emotions [EH]
[NSS] considers Beta to be 13-27 HZ, [AWI] considers it 14-38 HZ, [PWM] & [RA] consider it 13-40 HZ, and [VUG] (seems to) consider it 14-30 HZ. [CRI] lists it as either 12-36 or 14-36 – it contradicts itself in different parts of the article.
[NEU] breaks up Beta into ranges – Low Beta=12-15 HZ, Mid Beta=15-18 HZ, & High Beta=18.0+ HZ. [CRI] does as well.
13-40 Beta Range (according to [RA] + [PWM]) – a high frequency pattern, conducive to stimulating energy + action; most of our current institutionalized education is beta geared, characterized by logical, analytical, intellectual thinking, verbal communication, etc. [PWM via DW]
13.0 – Alleged sphincter resonance (mechanical)(not good) [TB]; Associated with Brow/Ajna chakra (Color=Indigo/Violet) (Body Parts=Pituitary,Lower Brain, Left Eye, Ears, Nose, Nervous System)(Effects=Visualization, Conceptualization)(Note=A) [OML]
13.8 – Associated with Frontal Lobes (Effects=the seventh sense, final decision) [TOS]
14-16 – associated with sleep spindles on EEG during second stage of sleep [EQ] [note SS said 10-14]
14-15 – Slows conditioned reflexes [SS]
14.0-30.0 – Beta Range (?I think? according to VUG) – This pattern is optimal for intense mental activities such as calculations, linear logical analyses & other highly structured functions [VUG via DW]
14.0 – Awake & alert [??]; Alert focusing, vitality, concentration on tasks [SS?]; Schumann Resonance (2nd of 7 frequencies. 7.83 HZ being the first) [TS+HSW]; Intelligence Enhancement in conjunction with 22.0 HZ (medium=audio-visual stimulation) [APE]
[APE] used audio-visual stimulation alternating between 14 & 22 HZ. Check the link under [APE]’s bibliography entry for more information.
14.1 “Earth Resonance” [SS]; Earth Harmonics – accelerated healing [DIV] (probably tied to Schumann Resonance above.)
15.0-18.0 Beta (mid) – increased mental ability, focus, alertness, IQ [NEU+CRI]; “alert but not agitated”/”aware of self & surroundings” [CRI]’;
15-24 Euphoria [SS]
I will vouch for this one – I find binaurally produced tones between 18 HZ & 21 HZ have very pleasant results, in a jogger’s high sort of way. This effect seems the strongest around 20 HZ. While other sources equate this frequency range with stress, I’m thinking it might be like the roar of a car engine – in small doses, it can be quite a rush, but too much of it can lead to a headache. The serotonin system is funny like that. [MPT]
15 – chronic pain [MB]; Sound which bypasses the ears for sublimination (auditory cortex) [RA]; Associated with Crown/Sahasrara chakra (Color=Violet/White) (Body Parts=Pineal, Upper Brain, Right Eye)(Effects=Integration of personality & spirituality.)(Note=B) [OML]
15.4 – Associated with Cortex (Effects=intelligence) [TOS]
16.0 – bottom limit of normal hearing [MP2]; Release oxygen & calcium into cells [CC]
16.4 Associated with top of head (Effects=spirit, liberation, transcendence) [TOS]
18.0-22.0 – Beta: outward awareness, sensory data [??] ; Throws brain’s sodium/potassium levels out of balance, resulting in mental fatigue. [INT]; Theoretically can be used to achieve a “relaxed body/focus mind” state of consciousness [DW]
[INT] + [DW] seem to contradict each other here.
18.0+ Beta (high) – fully awake, normal state of alertness, stress & anxiety [NEU]; Significant improvements in memory, reading & spelling are reported (in conjunction with 10 HZ) [RUS via DW]; (used to) improve hyperactive behavior [PWM via DW]; Associated with mental activity like math + planning – alert, but may also be agitated [CRI]
20-30 Phospene imagery, peak luminosity in visual field [SS]
20-40 Meditation For Stress Relief/Just At The Edge Of Audible Sound/As A Musical Backround [RA]
20.0 – fatigue, energize. Causes distress during labor.[EQ]; Human Hearing Threshold [SS]; Schumann Resonance (3rd frequency of 7) [TS+HSW]; Imposing subconscious commands on another (thought center) [RA]; Stimulation of pineal gland [ESR][JB] ; Helps with tinnitis (a condition that causes ear-ringing) [JB]; Adrenal Stimulant, (used on) sinus disorders/sinus infection/head cold/headache [RS]; Commonly used “cure-all” Rife Frequency [CR]
20.215 LSD-25 [PSI] (he implies it could mimic the effects of)
20.3 “Earth Resonance” [SS]
Probably the same thing as the Schumann Resonance at 20 HZ.
22.0 Used in conjunction with 14 HZ for intelligence enhancement (medium=audio-visual stimulation)[APE]; Used in conjunction with 40 HZ for ‘out of body’ travel [EWI via DW]; Also used with 40 HZ for psychic healing. [FAH via DW]
[APE] used audio-visual stimulation alternating between 14 and 22 HZ. Check the link under [APE]’s bibliography entry for more information.
22.027 Serotonin [PSI] (he’s unclear what he means by this)
25.0 Bypassing the eyes for images imprinting (visual cortex) [RA]; Tested clinically with patients who complain of anxiety [PGS via DW]
26.0 Schumann Resonance (4th frequency of 7) [TS+HSW];
26.0 – 28.0 Astral Projection / produced during meditation by some [ANO]
26.4 “Earth Resonance” [SS]
27 – 44 Frequency range that cats purr at – said to have restorative effects on the body, particularly the ‘healing and strengthening of bones’ [BON]
27.5 lowest note on a piano [MP2]
30 Meg Patterson used for marijuana. [MB3]
30 – 60 Gamma Range – little known but includes decision making in a fear situation, muscle tension, [EH]
[INT] considers Gamma to start at 40 HZ.
30 – 190 Lumbago [AT]
30-500 High Beta: Not associated currently with any state of mind. Some effects have been observed, but currently not enough research has been done in this area, to prove, or disprove, anything.; a few people able to replicate at will (?? – not sure what that last point means)
Starting at 30 HZ, sources begin to seriously disagree over what the names of each range are.
[EH] considers 30 to be the beginning of the Gamma range, which it believes run to 60. It then considers 60 to 120 to be the Lambda range.
Incidentally, [INT] believes that 40 is where Beta ends & Gamma begins.
31.32 Pituitary stimulation to release growth hormone (helps develop muscle, recover from injuries, rejuvenation effects) (this is a higher octave of the 7.83HZ Schumann Resonance) [HSW]
Note – NOT one of the seven Schumann Resonances – it’s a higher octave of the 7.83 HZ Schumann Resonance. I had originally thought it was related somehow to the Schumann Resonance at 33 HZ, and I was wrong. (Sorry.)
32 Desensitizer; enhanced vigour & alertness [MB]
33 Christ consciousness, hypersensitivity, Pyramid frequency (inside) ; Schumann Resonance (5th frequency of 7) [TS]
Funky coincidence it lines up with the Christ Consciousness & Pyramid frequency, eh? I’ve had some interesting results with this one — particularly when I overlap waves at 9.0 HZ (pyramid outside frequency). The mind tends to wander in funny ways.

36 – 44 Learning Frequencies, When [Actively] Studying Or Thinking. Helps To Maintain Alertness. Waking Operating State [RA]; Frequencies of the olfactory bulb, prepiriform cortex & amygdala [DSH via DW]; Coordinates simultaneous processing of information in different areas of the brain. Associated with high-level information processing. ‘A good memory is associated with well-regulated & efficient 40 HZ activity, whereas a 40 HZ deficiency creates learning disabilities.’ [CRI]

40-60 anxiolytic effects & stimulates release of beta-endorphines [MB]
43 – 193 Carcinomatosis [AT]
40.0 – dominant when problem solving in fearful situations. [EQ] ; Gamma – associated with information-rich task processing & high-level information processing [NEU]; “‘For scientists who study the human brain, even its simplest act of perception is an event of astonishing intricacy. 40 Hz brain activity may be a kind of binding mechanism’, said Dr. Rodolfo Llinas a professor of neuroscience at New York University. Llinas believes that the 40-cycle-per-second wave serves to connect structures in the cortex where advanced information processing occurs, and the thalamus, a lower brain region where complex relay & integrative functions are carried out.” [NME via NEU]; Used in conjunction with 22 HZ for ‘out of body’ travel [EWI via DW]; Also used with 22 HZ for psychic healing. [FAH via DW]; “40–Hz activity varies from 38.8 to 40.1-Hz, regardless of the electrode site. The average frequency is in the ~39.5-Hz range. In summary, when the body is profoundly relaxed & the mind is in a state of high focus and concentration, 20 & 40-Hz brain activity can be seen in the raw and quantitative EEG of some subjects. It is possible that 18 to 22-Hz Beta & possibly 40-Hz neurofeedback training may help create a “relaxed body/focused mind” state of consciousness.” [DW]; Activity in the ectosylvian & lateral cortex, medial geniculate, reticular formation, center median thalamus & hippocampus [ROW via DW]; Confirming Sheer et al.’s work,compared the EEG of middle- & high-I.Q. subjects during mental multiplication activity. A 40-Hz rhythm occurred just prior to the subject’s answering the question. Forty–Hz pulses are thought to lead to synchronization + coordination of neurons assigned to the processing of incoming sensory stimulation. Put in “computerese,” 40-Hz may be the brain’s “operating system” frequency [GIA via DW] Involved In The Processing Of Psi Information (see note) [EMC]
Considered the dividing point between beta waves + gamma waves, although there’s some disagreement about this. [INT] http://brain.web-us.com/40hz/defaul…
Gamblers were presented a computer screen with four playing cards shown on them, and then asked to guess which of the four cards would appear on the screen by itself next. Their guessing was about as accurate as random chance, BUT when they had their eyes on the correct card that would inevitably turn up, the amount of 40HZ activity registering in their brain was higher.

45.0 Schumann Resonance (7th frequency of 7)[TS]
46.98 – Useful for “weird effects” (use with 62.64 HZ and 70.47 HZ) [TB]
[TB] gets the award for most ambiguous description. Although, I’m including it since it’s a very specific frequency. I’ll research it further and try to dig up some additional information.
50-60 Documented negative effects too numerous to mention There is no correlation given with signal strength or modality used, i.e. audio-visual, EMF, magnetic, electrostatic, gravitic. Also, most ELF research is now Govt classified, particularly since the mid-1960’s when Hamer discovered behavioral effects as the result of applied sinusoidal field gradients as low as 4 volts. [SS via DW]
50.0 – dominant frequency of polyphasic muscle activity, mains electrical in U.K. [EQ]; Slower cerebral rhythms [??]
55.0 – Tantric yoga; stimulates the kundalini. [×]
60 – 120 Lambda Range – Little known but includes central nervous system activity [EH]

72 Emotional spectrum [??]; Used on sinusitis/sinus infection/head cold [RS]
73.6 Associated with genitals (higher octave of 2.30 HZ) [TOS]
80 Awareness & control of right direction. Appears to be involved in stimulating 5-hydroxytryptamine production, with 160Hz. Combine with 2.5 Hz. [EQ]
82.3 Associated with bladder (higher octave of 2.57 HZ) [TOS]
83 Third eye opening for some people
85.5 Associated with intestines (higher octave of 2.67 HZ) [TOS]
90.0 – 111.0 Pleasure-producing beta-endorphins rise between these frequencies. [PSI]
In the MIDI scale, the notes that would fall in this range begin with F#3 and go up to A3. [“A3” being the fourth octave up — since there’s an A0, and A1, A2 lower than it.] Playing the F#3 and the A3 as a chord seems to function as a good painkiller. An additional undertone in the alpha range of frequencies sometimes helps too. [Try adding a tone around 12.5 HZ].
90.0 Good feelings, security, well-being, balancing [??]
95.0-125.0 Acoustical Resonances of Assorted Ancient Structures [ACS via DW]
95.0 Use for pain along with 3040 HZ [ESR]
98.4 Associated with hara (3cm or 1.5 inch below navel, balance of pelvis) (higher octave of 3.07 HZ) [TOS]
100 Can help with pain [used with electrical stimulation] [CMP]
The site specifically mentions it can be good for pain initially, but then recommends using 0.5 or 1.5 to treat pain.
105 Overall view of complete situation

110.0 Frequency associated with stomach. [Note=A] [BH1][BH4]; Associated with ovaries (Effects=vitality, life at very level) (higher octave of 3.84 HZ) [TOS]
111 Beta endorphins [MB2]. cell regeneration [??]
117.3 Frequency associated with Pancreas [Note=C#] [BH1][BH4]
120 – 500 P.S.I., moving of objects, changing matter, transmutation, psychokinesis
120 Helps with fatigue (Medium=pad)[JB]; (used on) sinus disorders/sinus infection/head cold [RS]
125 Graham potentializer; Stimulation [MH]; (used on) sinusitis [RS]
126.22 – Sun, 32nd octave of Earth year [HC]; The Frequency Of The Sun (Note=C) (Color=Green) (Tempo=118.3 BPM) (Chakra=Manipura, also called Hara {associated with Navel & 3rd lumbar vertebrae}) (Effects=advances the feeling of centering of magic & of the transcendental) [HC/Planetware website]
There seems to be a little disagreement between [HC] & [HC/Planetware] over what exactly this is the frequency of – [HC] ties this into the period it takes the earth to revolve around the sun, while [HC/Planetware] says this is the frequency it would take an imaginary planet to orbit the outside edge of the sun. My money is on the second, since there is another frequency that is given for the Earth year. (136.1 HZ)
This is tricky to paraphrase, so here it is as it appeared on the Planetware website :
“Meditation carried out to this tone will lead to state beyond good and bad, shame and guilt, beyond space and time, knowledge and wisdom, action and rest an being and not-being. It leads to a state where being has no name, to a state where the all-one and the all encompassing are no longer separate entities but are reunited at their one common origin, the origin that is also you.”
132.0 Associated with kidneys (Effects=strength) (higher octave of 4.11 HZ) [TOS]; Associated with coccyx (small triangular bone at end of the spinal column) (higher octave of 2.06 HZ) [TOS]
136.1 Sun: light, warmth, joy, animus [RV]; Resonates with the earth year (Note=C#) (Color=Turqouise Green) (Effects=calming, meditative, relaxing, centering) [PSI]; Period it takes earth to revolve around sun (Tempo=63.8*127.6) (Chakra=Anahate/Heart chakra)(Effects=relaxing, soothing, balancing, harmony with the cosmos, associated with the soul {“frequency of the soul}) (Medicinal=Sedative) (Other=significant tone in Indian music {called it the “sadja” or “father to others” – it was a keynote} – corresponds to “OM” & the Christian “AMEN”) [HC/Planetware website]
Note : [PSI] seems to disagree a bit with the original source on the list. [PSI] says this one calms/centers, while the original source seems to associate it with happiness. Also some disagreement between [RV] and [HC/Planetware], once associating this with the sun, and the other associating this with the frequency with the earth year. I suppose you could associate the earth year with the sun, since it’s the time it takes the earth to go around the sun, but 126.22 HZ uses “frequency of the sun” in a little different context. See the comments with that frequency for more.
140.25 Pluto: power, crisis & changes [??]; Frequency associated with the orbit of Pluto; (Note=C#) (Color=blue-green) (Tempo=65.7 * 131.4 BPM) (Effects = support the magic group dynamic principle and is said to be responsible for integration into certain structures of society) [HC/Planetware website]
141.27 Mercury: intellectuality, mobility [??]; Frequency associated with orbit of Mercury (Note=C# or D) (Color=blue-green or blue) (Tempo=66.2) (Chakra=Vishudda/Throat chakra) (Effects=Supports speech center and communicative-intellectual principle, associated with communication and cleverness) [HC/Planetware]
[HC/Planetware] says the frequencies of planets revolving around the sun are less important than those of the moon, sun, and Earth.
Again, I’m not sure how [HC/planetware] is associating these frequencies with these chakras. {shrugs}
A discrepancy in the note and color – they’re both given twice – once as C# and blue-green, the second time as D and blue.
[HC/Planetware] and [BH] seem to associate different frequencies with the revolutions of each planet – these frequencies are determined by HC/Planetware by taking higher octaves of the actual period – octaves that are in the audible range. [BH] might use even higher octaves than [HC/Planetware] does, or some other method completely.
144.0 (helps with) headaches (Medium=pad)[JB]
144.72 Mars: activity, energy, freedom, humor [??] ; Frequency associated with the orbit of Mars (Note=D) (Color=blue) (Tempo=67.8 * 135.6 BPM) (Effect : Supports strength of will and focused energy, ability for achievement) [HC/Planetware]
146.0 (used on) sinus infection/head cold [RS]
147.0 Associated with the spleen/blood (Effects=Emotional Impulse) (higher octave of 4.6 HZ) [TOS]; Associated with genitals (higher octave of 2.30 HZ) [TOS]
147.85 Saturn: separation, sorrow, death [??]; Frequency associated with orbit of Saturn (Note=D) (Color=Blue) (Tempo=69.3 * 138.6 BPM) (Effects=enhances concentration and the process of becoming conscious + shows very clearly karmic connections, brings structure and order – is considered to be a cosmic controller) [HC/Planetware]
I’m not completely sure what the dual tempo means. I’ll have to research that further.
160.0 Appears to be involved in stimulating 5-hydroxytryptamine production, with 80 Hz. [EQ]; Use for rapid relief from headaches [ESR]; used on sinus infection/head cold [RS]
164.3 Frequency associated with Gall Bladder [Note=E] [BH1][BH4]
165.0 Associated with stomach (Effects=Emotional Acceptance) (higher octave of 5.14 HZ) [TOS]; Associated with bladder (higher octave of 2.57 HZ) [TOS]
171.0 Associated with lungs (Effects=Oxygen, Heat) (higher octave of 5.35 HZ) [TOS]; Associated with intestines (higher octave of 2.67 HZ) [TOS]
172.06 – Resonates with the Platonic year {about 26,000 years} (Note=F) (Color=purple-violet) (Effects=joyful, cheerful, spiritual effect) [PSI]; The Frequency Of The Platonic Year (Color=red-violet {purple}) (Tempo=80.6 BPM) (Chakra=Sahasrar/Crown chakra) (Effects=cheerfulness, clarity of spirit, cosmic unity on highest levels) (Medicinal=antidepressive) (Other=F is considered the tone of the spirit, and had a lot of significance to the Chinese) [HC/Planetware website]
Other sources [PM] disagree about the tone F being associated with the Crown chakra, which is how HC/Planetware connects this frequency to the crown chakra. [PM] considers the crown chakra to be associated with the B note, and not F.
176.0 – Frequency associated with the colon. [Note=F or F#] [BH1][BH4]
183.58 – Jupiter: growth, success, justice, spirituality [??] ; Frequency associated with the orbit of Jupiter (Note=F#) (Color=Red) (Tempo=86.05 * 172.1 BPM) (Effects : supports creative power and continuous construction) (Associated with Jupiter : Generosity, Continuity, Magnanimity, Joviality) [HC/planetware website]
185.0 – (used on) sinus infection/head cold [RS]
187.61 frequency of “moon culmination” ; [HC/planetware website]
194.18 frequency of Synodic “Earth” Day {the “day tone”} (Note=G) (Color=Orange Red) (Tempo=91.0 BPM) (Chakra=Muladhar/Base chakra) (Effects = dynamic, vitalizing)(Medicinal=”tonifies”) (Other=”weather determining” spheric frequency, influences proteins, brings one into harmony with nature”) [HC/planetware website]
Note : By “weather determining”, [HC/planetware] seems to imply that somebody tuned into this frequency may be able to predict the weather in the short-term future. I’m just a little, little bit skeptical of this one, but if anybody has any luck with it, let me know.
I’m not sure how [HC/planetware] is associating these chakras to these frequencies. It doesn’t seem to be based on the note, since G isn’t the note typically associated with the base chakra [per PM]. The associations might tie in with something astrological instead. {shrugs}.
194.71 – Earth: stability, grounding [??]; Key Of G resonates with frequency of earth day, the color orange-red, & has a dynamic, stimulating, and energizing effect on the body-mind. [PSI]
There seems to be some disagreement between [PSI] and the original source for this list. [PSI] associates this frequency with energizing, while the original source associates it with stability/grounding.
I think this one, and the one right below it [197.71 HZ] might be based on the same thing. One source might have done a typo, and then other sources based their information from that.
197.0 Associated with heart (Effects=love,warmth) (higher octave of 6.15) [TOS]; Associated with hara (3cm or 1.5 inch below navel, balance of pelvis) (higher octave of 3.07 HZ) [TOS]

207.36 – Uranus: spontaneity, independence, originality [??]; Frequency associated with orbit of Uranus {insert one of dozens of bad jokes here} (Note=G#) (Color=Orange) (Tempo = 97.2 BMP) (Effects = supports the power of surprise and renewal, has primeval and erotic power) [HC/planetware website]
210.42 frequency of Synodic Moon (Note=G#) (Color=orange) (Tempo=98.6 BPM) (Chakra=Svadisthan {2nd Chakra}) (Effects=stimulates sexual energy, supports erotic communication) (Medicinal=regulation of menstruation, disturbances in the gland and lymph system) [HC/planetware website]
211.44 – Neptune: the unconscious, secrets, imagination, spiritual love [??]; frequency associated with orbit of Neptune (Note=G#) (Color=orange) (Tempo=99.1 BPM) (Effects = supports intuition, the unconsciousness, and enhances the dream experience) [HC/planetware website]

289.4 – Frequency associated with orbit of Mars. [Note=D] [BH2]
293.0 – “unknown” Chakra (1:14) (Note=D+) (Saturn Orbit 296) [BH3]

330.0 Used to treat allergies in conjunction with 3 HZ [RS]
333.0 (used on) sinus infection/head cold [RS]
332.8 – Frequency associated with orbit of Sun (Note=E) [BH2]
When [BH2] says the “orbit of the sun”, I believe she means how long it would take an imaginary planet to orbit around the sun’s outer boundary [circumference]. This is how [HC/planetware] made this calculation – the period is then lowered a few octaves to get it into the audible sound range. That’s how [HC/planetware] does most of its calculations, and probably how [BH] does it as well. [HC/planetware], when lowering [or in the case of planets raising] the octave, seems to gun for lower tones than [BH] does. The [HC/planetware] tones would be a little “bassier”. Which is probably why the frequencies of all these astronomical phenomena that [HC/planetware] gives doesn’t line up with the frequencies that [BH] gives.
336.0 – Frequency associated with Molybdenum (mineral nutrient) [BH]
341.0 – Heart Chakra (1:12) (Note=F) [BH3]
342.0 – Associated with ears (Effects=hearing, formal concepts) (higher octave of 13.8 HZ) [TOS]; Associated with lungs (Effects=Oxygen, Heat) (higher octave of 5.35 HZ) [TOS]
352.0 – Frequency associated with bladder. (Note=F) [BH1][BH4]; Thymus Chakra (11:1) (Note=F#) [BH3]
There seems to be a discrepancy here as to which note this frequency is. [BH] cites both F and F#. [MPT]

<p style="text-align: center;">Since ancient times models have studied to describe the Harmony of the World. In the most diverse historical periods, research into the regularity between parameters of natural phenomena has undoubtedly been a key feature of doing science. The astronomer Johannes Kepler, one of the first scientists of the modern era, sought harmony, understood as a musical correlation expressed by mathematical regularities, in the planets of the solar system. He calculated the notes of each planet and organized them into harmonic configurations tuned to the musical system of just intonation. By referring to the numerical properties at the heart of just intonation, a musical tuning in which the frequencies of notes are related by ratios of small whole numbers, this study explores the harmonic relationships in terms of the numerical ratios between the molecular masses of pairs of hormones secreted by the same endocrine glands. By also making use of specific correspondences, indicated by the writer Rodney Collin, between endocrine glands of the human body and planets of the solar system (thymus/Venus, adrenal cortex/Earth, adrenal medulla/Mars, endocrine pancreas/main-belt asteroids, neurohypophysis/Jupiter, adenohypophysis/Saturn and testicle/Uranus), harmonic relationships are explored in numerical ratios between the molecular masses of pairs of hormones secreted by different glands and of pairs of hormones and hormone receptors. The analysis of these relationships shows their statistical significance in relation to just intonation. This suggests an opportunity for further research of harmonic principles in other areas of science.
